<h1>Bluetooth to FM Radio</h1>

<h4>This has been done before, but I wanted to put this up here since I've gotten this working myself now.</h4>
<p>We were about to go on a road trip, but the car we were going to take is pretty old. We're talking cassette tapes old.
Sorry to anyone who was around when those were popular. There are converters that take your cassette tape 
reader and convert that to an audio jack, but sadly most phones don't have an audio jack anymore. At least ours don't.
Being an engineer at heart, I decided to go with the most complicated solution and create a Bluetooth to FM radio 
"adapter" in GNURadio. Honestly, I feel like I was waiting for an excuse to do something like this. The first
part involved ironing out my FM broadcasting and recieving. This honestly took more time than it should have.
I finally got it working when I set my low pass filter up right. After that all I needed to do was transmit, 
which ended up being way easier. The only other thing I had to do was sync the audio sampling rate and the quadrature
rate and then the quadrature rate with the SDR sampling rate. Once the math was aligned we had liftoff. Here's a 
video of the final result.</p>

... There should be a video here.

<p>I wasn't satisfied with just one successful experiment so I called my brother up and we tested it in his car.
We found that my little SDR isn't quite powerful enough to compete with the radio stations in the open air, but
when we found a static channel the radio worked exactly as intended.</p>
