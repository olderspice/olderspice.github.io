<p>Here are some things I've been working on</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Weaponizing Portal 2</button>
<div class="content">
<p>I was searching for a youtube video to watch while I ate my lunch when I came across:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v5vCLLsqbA">This video on youtube.</a></p>

<p>The whole video was fascinating, and definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something to keep you entertained while you eat.
The video gave me an idea on how I could use portal 2 in a different way. I figured if it's open as a web server, then you can probably get it
to deliver malware. If you haven't seen the video yet, I'd check it out now, we're gonna be modifying the concept just a little bit. When you recieve
a file from a web server, there is a special content header that is used to tell your browser "Hey, file incoming". I added that header into the 
already brilliant mapspawn.nut code as seen in the video. After that, we simply edit the page content to be whatever we want in our file.</p>

<p>To utilize this: we launch portal 2, we start playing the game, then we navigate to the web server we created.</p>

... There should be a video here.

<p>It's short, simple, and the next time you're on an engagement where file delivery is a problem and you find a linux box with portal 2 preinstalled you'll know what to do ;)</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Bluetooth to FM Radio</button>
<div class="content">
<p>We were about to go on a road trip, but the car we were going to take is pretty old. We're talking cassette tapes old.
Sorry to anyone who was around when those were popular. There are converters that take your cassette tape 
reader and convert that to an audio jack, but sadly most phones don't have an audio jack anymore. At least ours don't.
Being an engineer at heart, I decided to go with the most complicated solution and create a Bluetooth to FM radio 
"adapter" in GNURadio. Honestly, I feel like I was waiting for an excuse to do something like this. The first
part involved ironing out my FM broadcasting and receiving. This took more time than it should have. There are a fair amount
of components involved behind the scenes of your radio receiver. You need a source, you need to cut the 
noise out from your source with a filter, and you need to adjust that source to work at the rate your
sink is working with. Not to mention troubleshoot driver issues. I finally got it working when I set my low pass filter up right. 
After that all I needed to do was transmit, which was way easier. The only other thing I had to do was sync the audio sampling rate and the quadrature
rate and then the quadrature rate with the SDR sampling rate. Once the math was aligned we had liftoff.</p>


<p>I wasn't satisfied with just one successful experiment so I called my brother up and we tested it in his car.
We found that my little SDR isn't quite powerful enough to compete with the radio stations in the open air, but
when we found a static channel the radio worked exactly as intended. Now that broadcasting was working as 
intended we needed to figure out how to turn this into a relay. Seeking maximum versatility for minimum effort, I 
ended up simply using the Audio source block. This would pass through my default recording device, and in pulse audio
 I was able to change the device that got passed through. Is it clean? No. Does it work? Oh yeah. Theoretically we 
 could do even more than just bluetooth with this. We can pass through audio from the computer, we could hook up a cd player. 
Alright, not necessarily unlimited options at our disposal, but I like the flexibility. And it works! </p>

<p>At the end of the day, you can buy something that does this. You can find your old iPod that will work with the 
cassette adapter. You can do any number of things that will work just fine. But when you think of a weird, cool way
 to do something, I say do it that way.</p>
